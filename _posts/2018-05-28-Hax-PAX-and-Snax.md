### Findings
Upon writing this I've managed my way into a few conferences now and thusfar I
can say that PAX East was by far the most involved undertaking. It started with
some instruction from a fellow operative for the general process to recreate the
badge from one I purchased to attend PAX South. After looking online for ticket
resellers and noticing the similarities between the East and South badges I
believed it would be none-to-difficult of a task to use Photoshop to alter the
appearance of the South badge to match that of the East badge.

First I needed to scan the badge and Photoshop it. The copier available to me
didn't have great resolution, about 72 DPI but, it was all I had. I scanned the
badge as large as I could and loaded it up in Photoshop CC. The first mistake
I believe they made was not randomizing the "entropy graphics" (small chunks of
random-ish pixelated patterns that cut through areas on the badge that would
normally give the appearance of a unique image) and instead having the same ones
between every badge they printed (let alone between East and South). However,
these small details made altering the badge to appear legit coupled with the
horrible resolution a somewhat tedious task - that and some of the scan was
clipped so I had to try and recreate those areas by eyeballing my physical
South badge.

The second hardest part about the Photoshop-ing process was "generating" some
details that each badge needed to be unique to pass off as real: a "unique" 6
digit number on the front that also appeared on the back in a different font
and an 8 digit number on the back as well. Keeping the numbers straight and
not screwing it up with mismatching made things all the more monotonous but
that was the majority of the difficulty: keeping things organized and not
screwing up before I sent it off to be printed.

The last task I had to do to make the badge complete I never got around to doing
but, in the end it didn't even matter because no one seemed to notice: creating
a small "X" cutout of a "scratch-off" type foil and sticking it to the front of
the badge. It was the thing that bothered me the most going into the conference
and, I made a special effort to hold my badge, along with all the junk in my
pockets, at the metal detectors so that the security wouldn't notice it.
However, at a third or fourth entry one guard had me place my things on a table
for inspection and looked directly at the badge without giving it a second
thought.

Once the team was in the rest was a cakewalk. Conference staff (or "Enforcers")
paid little to no attention to my lack of fully or partially displaying a badge.
I had goofed on the coloring for the back of the badges and I made an effort to
keep it facing forward but I doubt it would have mattered much. I believe one
area that may have been a bit of a dead-end for these badges would have been
the console checkout area. I believe the numbers and the QR code on the badges
play a specific role there in keeping track of who has what and trying to check
out a console may have alerted the Enforcers of our presence. Regardless, if
you bring your own controller(s) or don't want to participate in console
freeplay then this won't have much effect on you. All of the vendors and booths
are still wide open for you and all the free swag is available for your taking.ting

### Recommendations
1. My biggest advice for any badge creators that really want to secure their
conferences would be: have your badges scan. A QR code or a barcode are a huge
deterrant to any operatives seeking entrance. This won't stop those with the
knowledge of how to spoof these mechanisms but, it will create barrier of entry.
2. Don't post pictures of your badges online. In the case of PAX this is
somewhat difficult because they send out the badges long beforehand which gives
operatives the time to find a good picture on a reseller website.
3. Have security inside request to see badges if they're unsure.
